Process

Abstract

ïƒ˜	This project automates the process of generating and publishing SEO-optimized blog posts to WordPress using Google Apps Script, Gemini API, and Google Sheets. The automation fetches blog titles from a Google Sheet, generates full HTML blog content, and posts it directly to WordPress via the Post-by-Email feature.
Introduction

ïƒ˜Manually writing, formatting, and publishing blog posts can be time-consuming. This task addresses the challenge by automating blog content creation and publishing. It uses Gemini API for content generation, Google Apps Script for automation, and Google Sheets as a control panel to manage blog titles and status.
Tools & Technologies

Tool	:    Purpose
Google Apps Script	  :  Automation and integration between Google Sheets and APIs
Gemini API	 :   AI-powered blog content generation
Google Sheets	 :   Storage of blog titles, statuses, and generated content
WordPress (Post by Email)	:    Automatic publishing of generated blogs
Methodology

ïƒ˜	The following steps were taken to complete the task:
1. Created a Google Sheet with columns:Title, Status, and Content. 
2. Developed a Google Apps Script to read pending titles from the sheet. 
3 . Connected the script to Gemini API for generating HTML blog content. 
4. Used MailApp service to send the generated blog to WordPress via Post-by-Email. 
5. Updated the sheet status to 'Published' after posting. 
6. Ensured professional formatting in generated content.
Code Implementation

ïƒ˜	This Script is written in Java Script.

function postBlogsToWordPress() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  var data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();

  var GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KYE"; // Replace with your Gemini API key
  var WP_EMAIL = "YOUR_EMAIL_GENRATED_BY_WORDPRESS"; // Replace with your WordPress Post-by-Email address

  for (var i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
    var title = data[i][0];
    var status = data[i][1];

    if (status.toLowerCase() === "pending") {
      var content = generateBlogContentGemini(GEMINI_API_KEY, title);

      // Send blog to WordPress
      MailApp.sendEmail({
        to: WP_EMAIL,
        subject: title,
        htmlBody: content // Send HTML for proper formatting
      });

      // Update sheet
      sheet.getRange(i + 1, 2).setValue("Published");
      sheet.getRange(i + 1, 3).setValue(content);

      Utilities.sleep(3000); // Prevent rate limiting
      break; // Process one blog per run
    }
  }
}

function generateBlogContentGemini(apiKey, title) {
  var prompt = `
Write a 1000-word SEO-optimized blog post for the title: "${title}".
Use only clean HTML formatting (no emojis, no hashtags, no unnecessary special characters).
Use <h2> for main sections and <h3> for sub-sections.
Include relevant links for tools, websites, or references if needed.
Do not insert images, logos, or large banners.
Provide a meta description at the top in a <p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> ...</p> format.
Ensure the style looks professional and ready for a blog.
`;

  var url = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=" + apiKey;

  var payload = {
    contents: [
      { parts: [{ text: prompt }] }
    ]
  };

  var options = {
    method: "post",
    contentType: "application/json",
    payload: JSON.stringify(payload),
    muteHttpExceptions: true
  };

  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);
  var json = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());

  return json.candidates && json.candidates.length > 0
    ? json.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text.trim()
    : "<p>Error: No content generated.</p>";
}

Output

ïƒ˜	The following screenshots show the system in action: - Google Sheet before and after running the script - Apps Script editor with code - Word Press blog post published automatically
